Fuzzing is an increasingly popular technique for testing software. As a result, 
many fuzzers have been developed, but one has not emerged as consistently superior. 
The growing number of available fuzzers has presented software developers with a 
selection burden.  To resolve this issue, Fu et al. developed \texttt{Autofz}. 
\texttt{Autofz} is a dynamic fuzzer that seeks to maximize the bitmap coverage fuzzed
 by deploying individual fuzzers with resources proportional to their runtime 
 performance. This paper confirmed the effectiveness of \texttt{autofz} as proposed, 
 expanded \texttt{autofz} for execution on ARM64 architectures, and introduced new
 algorithms for evaluating the runtime performance of the individual fuzzers within 
 \texttt{autofz}.
