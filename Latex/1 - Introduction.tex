Due to the success of fuzzing as a method of identifying bugs in software, many fuzzers have been 
developed. Unfortunately, selecting a fuzzer is a difficult task. The following challenges prevent 
researchers from quickly selecting a fuzzer using benchmarking: no fuzzer consistently outperforms 
the others, the efficacy of a fuzzer is inconsistent throughout its execution, and fuzzing results 
are not reproducible.

In response to these problems, Autofz was developed. Autofz leverages multiple fuzzers by dynamically 
allocating resources to fuzzers using runtime data. This methodology empowers Autofz to eliminate the 
fuzzer selection problem and outperform individual fuzzers.

In spite of these successes, Autofz is not perfect. While there is no consensus on the best way to 
assess fuzzers, Autofz oversimplifies this process. Autofz relies on a singular metric, bitmap 
coverage, to rank its fuzzers and allocate resources. Autofz may perform even better if it employs 
additional metrics when assigning resources to its fuzzers.

Moreover, Autofz prides itself on streamlining the fuzzer selection process for the novel user, but 
it was designed for and tested on an AMD Ryzen 9 3900 with 24 cores and 32 GB memory. This equipment 
is not representative of the standard user, and as a result, Autofz needs to be adapted for use in 
additional environments. \cite{Fu}

In this effort, we seek to improve Autofz and answer the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1.} Can we successfully reproduce a working tool chain from
    Fu et al. \cite{Fu} on portable ARM64 computing devices?
    \item \textbf{RQ2.} Can we reproduce the results (e.g. number of defects found)
     of fuzzing at least two targets from Fu et al. \cite{Fu} on our ARM64-based
      tool chain?
    \item \textbf{RQ3.} Autofz uses a single metric (i.e. AFL bitmap coverage) for
     allocation of resources to fuzzers. Can we identify at least one additional,
     alternate metric that will improve this allocation?
\end{itemize}
