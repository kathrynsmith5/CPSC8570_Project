To compare the  modified \texttt{autofz} with the proposed \texttt{autofz}, we tested it against the 
targets: exiv2, nm, intotocap, and tcpdump. Figure \ref{fig:exiv2_compare_orig_arm64} 
displays bitmap density covered by the individual algorithms in our ARM64 implementation, 
as compared to a similar plot from Fu et al.\cite{fu_autofz_2023}.

\end{figure}

Testing indicates that the ARM64 compatible autofz performs similarly to the unmodified \texttt{autofz}. 
Bitmap density coverage of tttext{autofz} is plottted alogside our ARM64 compatible tttext{autofz} in figure 
\ref{fig:tcpdump_compare_orig_arm64}. After 24 hours, both implementations achieved similar bitmap coverage.
tttext{Autofz} followed a linear trend while ARM64 tttext{autofz} followed a logarithmic trend. Consequently, 
the orignal tttext{autofz} took longer to achieve the same bitmap coverage.

Bug coverage of our initial fuzzing campaign against tcpdump is plotted in figure \ref{figs:tcp_compare_orig_arm64_ub.png}, 
shown as a comparison are results from Fu et al.\cite{fu_autofz_2023}. While the ARM64 adaptation of \texttt{autofz} achieved similar
performance to the original in bitmap coverage, it out performed the origional in bug discovery. These findings suggests that 
\texttt{autofz} can be successfully adapted for the ARM64 architecture and may even out perform better.

In addition to producing an ARM64 compatible \texttt{autofz}, we identified a potential improvement for \texttt{autofz}.
Existing versions of \texttt{autofz} use bitmap coverage to rank fuzzers during the preparation, but bitmap
coverage may not be the best metric for identifying the most effective fuzzers for a target. While
bitmap coverage indicates the portion of a target that was fuzzed, it does not guarantee bug discovery.
To resolve these problems, we plan to modify \texttt{autofz}, so fuzzers that discover more bugs during the
preparation phase are rewarded with more resources during the focus phase because discovering more bugs
across a smaller area of code decreases the attack surface by more entry points than discovering fewer
bugs over a greater area of the code.
