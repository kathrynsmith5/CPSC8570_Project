To compare the modified \texttt{autofz} with the proposed \texttt{autofz}, we tested it against the 
targets: exiv2, nm, intotocap, and tcpdump. 

Figure \ref{fig:exiv2_compare_orig_arm64} displays bitmap density covered by the individual algorithms in our AMD64 implementation, 
as compared to a similar plot from Fu et al.\cite{fu_autofz_2023}. While our recreation of autofz achieved lower bitmap coverage than 
the version published by Fu et al., our individual fuzzers also achieved lower bitmap coverage. As a result, our replica still 
outperformed all other individual fuzzers tested in our environment. This is consistant
with Fu et al. findings and further proves that \texttt{autofz} is seperior to individual fuzzers.

Testing also indicates that the ARM64 compatible \texttt{autofz} performs similarly to the unmodified AMD64 \texttt{autofz}. 
Bitmap density coverage of \texttt{autofz} is plottted alogside our ARM64 compatible \texttt{autofz} in figure 
\ref{fig:tcpdump_compare_orig_arm64}. After 24 hours, both implementations achieved similar bitmap coverage.
\texttt{Autofz}'s bitmap coverage grew linearly while ARM64 \texttt{autofz} followed a logarithmic trend. Consequently, 
the orignal \texttt{autofz} took longer to achieve the same bitmap coverage.

Bug coverage of our ARM64 fuzzing campaign against tcpdump is plotted in figure \ref{figs:tcp_compare_orig_arm64_ub.png}, 
shown as a comparison are results from Fu et al.\cite{fu_autofz_2023}. While the ARM64 adaptation of \texttt{autofz} achieved similar
performance to the original in bitmap coverage, it out performed the original in bug discovery. Since the other targets followed similar trends
when fuzzed with ARM64 \texttt{autofz}, \texttt{autofz} can be successfully adapted for the ARM64 architecture.

In addition to producing an ARM64 compatible \texttt{autofz}, we identified a potential improvement for \texttt{autofz}.
Existing versions of \texttt{autofz} use bitmap coverage to rank fuzzers during the preparation, but bitmap
coverage may not be the best metric for identifying the most effective fuzzers for a target. While
bitmap coverage indicates the portion of a target that was fuzzed, it does not guarantee bug discovery.
To resolve these problems, we plan to modify \texttt{autofz}, so fuzzers that discover more bugs during the
preparation phase are rewarded with more resources during the focus phase because discovering more bugs
across a smaller area of code decreases the attack surface by more entry points than discovering fewer
bugs over a greater area of the code.
