To compare the  modified \texttt{autofz} with the proposed \texttt{autofz}, we tested it against the 
targets: exiv2, nm, intotocap, and tcpdump. Initial test indicate that the ARM64 compatible 
autofz performs similarly to the unmodified \texttt{autofz}. Figure \ref{fig:exiv2_compare_orig_arm64} 
displays bitmap density covered of the individual algorithms in our ARM64 implementation, 
as compared to a similar plot from Fu et. al\cite{fu_autofz_2023}.

Bitmap density coverage of our initial fuzzing campaign against tcpdump is plotted 
in figure \ref{fig:tcpdump_bmdensity_8Mar2024}, shown as a comparison with results 
from Fu et al.\cite{fu_autofz_2023}.

In addition to producing an ARM64 compatible \texttt{autofz}, we identified a potential improvement for \texttt{autofz}.
Existing versions of \texttt{autofz} use bitmap coverage to rank fuzzers during the preparation, but bitmap
coverage may not be the best metric for identifying the most effective fuzzers for a target. While
bitmap coverage indicates the portion of a target that was fuzzed, it does not guarantee bug discovery.
To resolve these problems, we plan to modify \texttt{autofz}, so fuzzers that discover more bugs during the
preparation phase are rewarded with more resources during the focus phase because discovering more bugs
across a smaller area of code decreases the attack surface by more entry points than discovering fewer
bugs over a greater area of the code.
