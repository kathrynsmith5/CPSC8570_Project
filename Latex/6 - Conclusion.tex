As presented by Fu et al., \texttt{autofz} achieves greater bitmap coverage than individual 
fuzzers, and it is an effective means of eliminating the fuzzer selection burden \cite{fu_autofz_2023}. 
When adapted for the ARM64 architecture, \texttt{autofz} remains effective. 
While alternative resources allocation algorithms show potential for improving the number of bugs discovered
and bitmap fuzzed by \texttt{autofz}, more testing is needed to identify which configuration is best.
